Paulo Coelho's masterpiece tells the magical story of Santiago, an Andalusian shepherd boy who yearns to travel in search of a worldly treasure as extravagant as any ever found. The story of the treasures Santiago finds along the way teaches us, as only a few stories can, about the essential wisdom of listening to our hearts, learning to read the omens strewn along life's path, and, above all, following our dreams.", "91891ef1-b04c-4fd8-afe9-b945ca4ebcae.webp", 1690.00m, null, 0, 99, "Spiritual Growth", "The Alchemist, Gift Edition" },

Our answer must consist not in talk and meditation, but in right action and in right conduct. Life ultimately means taking the responsibility to find the right answer to its problems and to fulfill the tasks which it constantly sets for each individual. When Man's Search for Meaning was first published in 1959, it was hailed by Carl Rogers as 'one of the outstanding contributions to psychological thought in the last fifty years.' Now, more than forty years and 4 million copies later, this tribute to hope in the face of unimaginable loss has emerged as a true classic. Man's Search for Meaning--at once a memoir, a self-help book, and a psychology manual-is the story of psychiatrist Viktor Frankl's struggle for survival during his three years in Auschwitz and other Nazi concentration camps. Yet rather than 'a tale concerned with the great horrors,' Frankl focuses in on the 'hard fight for existence' waged by 'the great army of unknown and unrecorded.'", "12b2c75e-76ae-4796-ab31-54d6ac066fc9.webp", 535.00m, null, 0, 99, "Inspirational", "Man's Search for Meaning, Export Edition" },

What transforms this book from words on a page to effective daily practices are the ten guideposts to wholehearted living.
